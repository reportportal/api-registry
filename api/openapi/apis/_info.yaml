    This is the API documentation for ReportPortal. We describe this documentation
    following our [API Principles](https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal-common-api/blob/main/docs/api-principles.md)
    and [RESTful API Guidelines](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/).

    Because this documentation is created according to the
    [API design first approach](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/adopting-an-api-first-approach/),
    it doesn't contain information about all existing endpoints. There are only pre-designed endpoints.
    If you want to see the full documentation, you can check
    the [Auto-generated API documentation](https://reportportal.io/docs/category/api/service-api).

    # Introduction

    ReportPortal is a service for continuous testing.
    It provides a platform for test automation and allows you to analyze
    the results of tests in various ways. The service is implemented as a web
    application and is available through a web interface or API.

    # Authentication

    ReportPortal uses the [JWT](https://jwt.io/) authentication protocol for UI client requests and
    the [API Key](https://reportportal.io/docs/reportportal-configuration/HowToGetAnAccessTokenInReportPortal/#2-authorization-with-users-api-key-for-agents)
    for agent requests.

    Both approaches use the same security scheme: `Bearer`.
