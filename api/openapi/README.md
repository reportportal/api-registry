# OpenAPI Specification for ReportPortal API

This directory contains the OpenAPI specification. The specification includes:

- `reportportal-api.yaml` - is a autogenerated [file](reportportal-api.yaml) that contains all apis.
- `apis` - the directory containing the OpenAPI specifications grouped by logical parts of the API.
- `models` - the directory containing the OpenAPI shared models.
- `parameters` - the directory containing the OpenAPI shared parameters.
- `types` - the directory contains adjusted base types like `string`, `integer`, etc.
- `enums` - the directory contains `string` types with enumerations.

All apis use shared models, security definitions and parameters.
However, each api may have its own specific models, security definitions and parameters.

```bash
make bundle file=file.yaml
```

Bundle all apis into directory `build/openapi/`.

## Common tags for development status

There are common tags that are used in all endpoints for managing the status of the endpoint:

```yaml
tags:
  - name: In progress
    description: Endpoints that are in designing
  - name: Ready for implementation
    description: Endpoints that are ready for development
