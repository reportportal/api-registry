    This is the API documentation for ReportPortal. We describe this
    documentation

    following our [API
    Principles](https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal-common-api/blob/main/docs/api-principles.md)

    and [RESTful API
    Guidelines](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/).


    Because this documentation is created according to the

    [API design first
    approach](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/adopting-an-api-first-approach/),

    it doesn't contain information about all existing endpoints. There are only
    pre-designed endpoints.

    If you want to see the full documentation, you can check

    the [Auto-generated API
    documentation](https://reportportal.io/docs/category/api/service-api).


    # Introduction


    ReportPortal is a service for continuous testing.

    It provides a platform for test automation and allows you to analyze

    the results of tests in various ways. The service is implemented as a web

    application and is available through a web interface or API.


    # Authentication


    ReportPortal uses the [JWT](https://jwt.io/) authentication protocol for UI
    client requests and

    the [API
    Key](https://reportportal.io/docs/reportportal-configuration/HowToGetAnAccessTokenInReportPortal/#2-authorization-with-users-api-key-for-agents)

    for agent requests.


    Both approaches use the same security scheme: `Bearer`.
